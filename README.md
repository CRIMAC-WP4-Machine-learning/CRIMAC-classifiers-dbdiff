# Marine Acoustic Classification: Segmentation of Echosounder Data using frequency differentions

## Introduction

A simple dbdiff classifier on the preprocessed data

* The main objective of this repository is to **classify acoustic backscatter in echosounder data**.

This repository contains scripts for:
* Creating diff .zarr file


## Prerequisites
* The code on this repository was tested using Python 3.8 and the requirements which are listed in the requirements.txt document.
